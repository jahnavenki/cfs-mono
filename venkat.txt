Subject: Preview URLs Being Indexed by Search Engines Despite Blocking Rules

Description of Issue:

We are encountering an issue where URLs from our AEM Cloud preview environment are being indexed by search engines, specifically Google. This is affecting the search results for our production site and exposing preview links to public users, which should not be happening.

Context:

Our preview environment (https://preview-p110482-e1080534.adobeaemcloud.com) is showing up in search results. We have identified multiple instances where Google has indexed URLs from this environment, such as:

https://preview-p110482-e1080534.adobeaemcloud.com/join-now.html?...
https://preview-p110482-e1080534.adobeaemcloud.com/personal/tools-resources/download-cfs-edge-app-now.html?...
Despite our attempts to block these URLs, they are still appearing in search results.

Technical Steps Taken:

We have already implemented the following measures to block these preview URLs from being indexed:

Dispatcher Rewrite Rule:

apache
Copy code
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^preview [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [F,L]
robots.txt Configuration:

plaintext
Copy code
User-agent: *
Disallow: /preview
Disallow: /*adobe_mc=*
Internal Links Check: We have audited our production site and ensured that no links are pointing to the preview environment.

Cache Invalidations: We've purged caches from both our CDN and AEM Dispatcher, ensuring the rules are applied correctly.

Expected Behavior:

Preview URLs such as https://preview-p110482-e1080534.adobeaemcloud.com/... should not be indexed by Google or any other search engine.

Request for Assistance:

We request support in identifying if there is any additional configuration or settings within Adobe AEM Cloud Service that need to be adjusted to ensure that preview URLs are completely blocked from being indexed by search engines. Could there be any issue with the dispatcher rules, or is there a way to enhance blocking through Adobe's infrastructure?

Thank you for your assistance in resolving this issue.
