Step 1: Verify Site Ownership
Go to Google Search Console: Google Search Console.
Click Start Now and sign in with your Google account.
Add your non-production domain (e.g., https://preview-p110482-e1080534.adobeaemcloud.com) to Search Console by clicking Add Property.
Select the URL Prefix method.
Follow one of these verification methods:
Download HTML File:
Download the HTML verification file provided.
Upload it to the root directory of the non-production domain using AEM or dispatcher access.
Verify ownership in Search Console.
Alternative Methods:
Use a meta tag in the <head> section of your preview site's HTML.
Add a TXT record to your DNS settings.
Use Google Tag Manager to add the verification code.
Step 2: Submit Removal Request
After verifying ownership, navigate to Google Search Console > Index > Removals.
Click on New Request.
Select Temporary Removal.
Enter the non-production domain URL (or use a wildcard for all URLs under the domain, e.g., https://preview-p110482-e1080534.adobeaemcloud.com/*).
Submit the request.
Step 3: Prevent Future Indexing
To prevent the domain from being indexed again:

Add a robots.txt file to disallow all bots:
makefile
Copy code
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
Ensure that non-production environments have proper authentication or IP whitelisting to block unauthorized access.
Verify that no non-prod links are shared externally.
